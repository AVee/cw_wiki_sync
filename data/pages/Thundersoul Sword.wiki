 With a name like Thundersoul, you'd expect it to spark. A mithril-steel hybrid fades from dark blue to shining steel at the tip, and is etched with zig-zagging lines of imitation lightning outlined in white, before darkening as it fades to the steel. A bold 3 and a half feet long, it's nicknamed Thunder due to the crackling produced during forging.
