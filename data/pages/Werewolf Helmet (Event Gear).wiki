|DetailedDescription=Similar to a Lion Helmet, except wolf like. A steel helmet is made as a base, before a fake mouth and skull are formed and added. With fur, it resembles a wolf's head. Offering all around protection intimidation even without a full set, many users value the animalistic style of this helmet. Users are advised to avoid adding silver trim, however.
