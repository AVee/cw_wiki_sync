=Characteristics=
{{InfoOverview}}

=Acquisition=
When starting the game and using the button "Me" or typing <code>/me</code>, the player will find a short notice on the top of the message:
 :Exclamationmark: Please report to your captain in the castle chat. The password is ZOM ODO.
''(Note: The password is randomly generated for each player)''

Joining the linked castle chat and typing out those letters given in the password awards the player with a cape, that can be equipped next to all standard equipment.
 Earned: '''[[Royal Guard Cape]]'''. Check <code>/inv</code> to wear it.

=Trivia=
In earlier versions of the game the {{PAGENAME}} could be bought in the [[Shop|castle shop]] for 1 :Gold:, this got deactivated later on and now the item can only be acquired through [[Captain Arthur]].
