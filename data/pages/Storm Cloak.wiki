The {{PAGENAME}} is a {{#show: {{PAGENAME}} |?ItemType}}. It was introduced with the [[Game updates/2018-06-30|June 30th, 2018 game update]].

 Nicknamed the Storm Cloak due to an accident in a thunderstorm, the Storm Cloak is a favorite among assassins. Essentially a reinforced Royal Cape, it has a newly attached hood and metal weave to the inside. Capable of stopping some arrows and most dagger strikes, many people enjoy the added protection.

{{InfoOverview}}
