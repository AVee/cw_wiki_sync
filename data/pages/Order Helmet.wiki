|DetailedDescription=Forged in two halves, they are reinforced in the middle by a strip of metal. The neck and chin are low on the user, where it connects to the armor like a metal bracket, hooking and locking to the chestpiece. 5 indivdual latches help ensure the wearer never loses their helmet, from the horde of invaders that clamber against the walls.
