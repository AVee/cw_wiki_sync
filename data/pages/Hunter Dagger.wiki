The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a {{#show: {{PAGENAME}} |?ItemType}} of the type {{#show: {{PAGENAME}} |?ItemSubType}}. It was added to the game with the April 3, 2018 update.

 Taking motivation from the chestpiece of the same set, the mithril blade is more advanced than the castle shop's dagger. Shaped like a kitchen knife, one side has a blade, while the other side is a ripple of serrated, thick, bent teeth. Exceeding in stabbing, slashing, hacking and even sawing, the Hunter Dagger takes those off guard with ease.

{{InfoOverview}}

=Acquisition=
The {{PAGENAME}} is not sold in the [[Shop|Castle Shop]], it can only be crafted with the [[Recipe|recipe]] and the items for the recipe or by buying the finished item via [[Auction|auctions]] from other players for [[Pouch of Gold|Pouches of Gold]].
==Crafting==
The {{PAGENAME}} can be crafted with the [[Skill|skill]] {{#show: {{PAGENAME}} |?SkillCraft}} on level {{#show: {{PAGENAME}} |?SkillCraftLevel}}. This is only possible for [[Blacksmith|blacksmiths]], so it requires either being a Blacksmith with this skill or buying it from a [[Master Shop|Blacksmith Shop]] with the complete list of necessary items in the inventory.
