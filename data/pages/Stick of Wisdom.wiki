|DetailedDescription=A smart stick. Given out to those who helped create the encyclopedia of the land, or wiki, detailing all armors, weapons, events, craftables, resources, and parts... A laborous task. About the size of a staff, it's capped with an energizing green orb, giving the wielder extra stamina and seemingly luck. Thank you for helping!
