|FreeTextOverview=Unlike other [[Weapon|weapons]] the {{PAGENAME}} is listed under ''Equipment'' in the [[Shop|shop]] and not weapons, but it uses the [[Weapon|Off Hand Weapon]] slot to be equipped, as all other [[Weapon|weapons]] do. It was added to the game with the April 3, 2018 update.

|DetailedDescription=The handcrafted shield features an emblazoned emblem of your castle's symbol in gold thread, inserted into the small depths of an etching. The gold twinkles out from the bronze like overlay of the shield, triangle in shape. It sharply bends downwards, and raises in the corners to provide a wide area of protection for the castle defenders.
