==Flavor text==
 Silver is wrapped over an iron core to give a neat appearance but strength for heavy duty use. About 4 foot long and thin, the sword is popular for half-swording, where the blade is gripped to increase control, and used like a knife. The blade is as popular for combat as it is for sport, where some dulled down swords are used in fencing.
